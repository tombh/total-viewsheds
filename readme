A sample model (INPUTNAME.bil) is provided: 2000x2000 elevation data, with

- 2-byte integer, little endian, in meters.
- 10x10m resolution
- Placed at 4080000 360000 UTM 30S ED50 (Malaga,Spain)

Any other input model should have a square size (non-square sizes hasn't been considered)
and changes to Defs.h may be required: i.e.

xdim and dim
xstep (scale)
observer's height (meters)
NTHREAD: architectural dependant
BW: Related to L1cache size and ~sqrt(xdim)


Usage: 

0) Edit makefile and change compiler and options. Run make

1) Run ./precomp.out initially, or if you change xdim to different value
(that is, precomputed values in sort directory are 

2) Run ./comp.out to build totalviewshed map. Results (in output folder) include:
	- Raster data: INPUTNAME_sur.dat
	- Image: INPUTNAME.png (Jet colormap from 0 to 10000Hm2)
	- kml file: Overlay image in Google Earth

The software includes kernels for:

- Total Viewshed: This is the default kernel. The use of any other kernel is not recommended.
- Volume: To compute total volumetric visibility
- Vectorized surface: Total viewshed with vectorized kernel
- Masked surface: Total viewshed with masked areas (Cell tower location algorithm)
- Horizon: Horizon computation (excluded in this version)
- Empty kernel: For timing
- Single viewshed kernel (Cell tower location algorithm)
-
