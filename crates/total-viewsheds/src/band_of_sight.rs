//! The Band of Sight (`BoS`) is essentially the line of sight. In other
//! words: which DEM points fall along a line 'as the crow flies'.
//!
//! The conception of the `BoS` here is different to traditional 'V'-shaped
//! methods. Here we use a parallel band. Consider the following DEM,
//! where '/' represents the sides of a single `BoS`:
//!
//!    .  .  .  .  +  /  .  .  .
//!    .  .  .  /  +  .  .  .  .
//!    .  .  .  +  /  .  .  .  .
//!    .  .  /  +  .  .  .  .  .
//!    .  . (+) /  .  .  .  .  .
//!    .  /  +  .  .  .  .  .  .
//!    .  +  /  .  .  .  .  .  .
//!    /  +  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
//!    +  /  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
//!
//! The '(+)' is the viewer, or the Point of View (`PoV`) as it's referred
//! to here. The other '+'s are the points within the band of sight. In
//! effect there are actually 2 bands here, one from looking forward (the
//! front band) and another looking backwards (the back band).
//!
//! Even though `BoS`s are needed for every point (well every point that
//! doesn't have its line of sight truncated by the edge of the DEM) we
//! only need to calculate the *shape* of one `BoS` per sector angle. That
//! shape can then be applied to every point. The shape is described by
//! deltas describing the relative path from any given point. As far as I
//! know describing `BoS` shapes is a novel contribution to the state of the
//! art in viewshed analysis - I'd be very interested to know if you know
//! of any previous precedent.
//!
//! To create a single `BoS` from which to define the master shape for a
//! sector, we use the sorted DEM points from the `Axes` class. Using the
//! `sector_ordered` points we can populate the `BoS` but we don't know the
//! perpendicular distance each '+' point is from the `PoV` '(+)'. To then
//! order this specific subset of the DEM we use the `sight_ordered`
//! points.
//!
//! Note that the size of the `BoS` is defined via the maximum line of sight.
//! The maximum line of sight is converted to the number of non-diagonal
//! DEM points that would reach such a distance and that is used to define the
//! size of the `BoS`. Note that for diagonal distances the same number of points
//! will actually reach further, namely √2 times further in the extreme case,
//! (calculated from how much longer the diagonal of a square is than its width).
//! So this over-fitting shouldn't be a problem.
